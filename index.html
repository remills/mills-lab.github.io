		Our research group is primarily focused on the analysis of whole genome sequence data to identify genetic variation (primarily structural variation) and examine their potential functional impact in disease phenotypes.
		We are particularly interested in analyzing complex regions of the genome that are not easily resolved through modern sequencing approaches and which may exhibity interesting mechanistic origins.
		We are also interested in the large-scale integration of genomic, expression, methylation and proteomic data sets, as well as the application of whole genome sequence analysis in clinical diagnostics.
